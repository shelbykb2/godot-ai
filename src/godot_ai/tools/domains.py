"""Tool-domain catalog and exclude-list parsing.

Some MCP clients (notably Antigravity) reject connections whose total tool
count exceeds a hard limit (100 for Antigravity). `defer_loading` meta only
helps clients that speak Anthropic's tool-search — others still see every
registered tool at handshake time. To fit under such limits, the server
accepts `--exclude-domains` and drops whole domains' non-core tools before
registration.

This module is the single source of truth for:
  - the canonical ordered list of domains (`DOMAINS`)
  - which domains contain always-on core tools (`CORE_BEARING_DOMAINS`)
  - the core tools themselves (`CORE_TOOLS`) — shown as an "always on" row
    in the plugin's Tools UI
  - `parse_exclude_list(raw)` — CLI/plugin input parser
